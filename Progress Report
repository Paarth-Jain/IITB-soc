# Virtual Keyboard

##Overview
---
We aim to build a laser projected keyboard which when typed upon, outputs the corresponding
key press onto a monitor in real time.


## Flow Chart
---
* We shall build the software part in python because of the extensive library support and the easily comprehendable syntax. 
* Learning basic python syntax and the relevant libraries like Numpy, Scipy, Pandas and matplotlib etc, and getting our hands dirty.
* The next step would be to learn OpenCV (open sourced- computer vision library), and ofcourse practicing the skills.

## Progress Report

* 23rd to 1st April 2020
  - I revised (python)[https://www.learnpython.org/], and read some new topics( Error, Exception Handling ,Function arguments amongst others) 
  - Studied the (Scipy docs)[https://scipy-lectures.org/] on a basic level for knowledge of the relevant libraries.
  - Already had a Github a github profile and had Ubuntu on my laptop.
